System Requirements
-------------------

To work with the Editor, you need following:

-   Windows XP or higher
-   At least 128 Mb RAM
-   .NET 2.0 Framework
-   Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Service Pack 1 Redistributable

Note that games you create do **NOT** require .NET nor Visual C++
redistributable.

Any games you create have at least these system requirements:

-   Pentium or higher processor
-   64 Mb RAM
-   Windows 98, ME, 2000, XP, Vista, Seven with DirectX 5 or above
-   Supports all DirectX-compatible sound and video cards

Depending on your game's resolution and colour depth, you may have
higher requirements. The processor required is as follows:

-   320x200, 256-colour: Any Pentium-class system
-   640x400, 256-colour: 266 Mhz or above
-   800x600, 256-colour: 500 Mhz or above recommended
-   320x200, 16-bit colour: 233 Mhz or above
-   640x400, 16-bit colour: 500 Mhz system minimum, may need faster if
    you use large objects
-   800x600, 16-bit colour: 600 Mhz system minimum, may need faster if
    you use large objects
-   320x200, 32-bit colour: 300 Mhz or above
-   640x400, 32-bit colour: 700 Mhz system minimum, may need faster if
    you use large objects
-   800x600, 32-bit colour: 900 Mhz system minimum, may need faster if
    you use large objects

These requirements are not an exact science though - game speed is
affected by many factors, including how many objects/characters are on
the screen, whether background music is playing, the complexity of your
scripts, and more. The best way to determine the requirements of your
game are to test it on different computer configurations.
