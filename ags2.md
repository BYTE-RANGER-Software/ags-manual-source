Welcome to AGS!

Adventure Game Studio allows you to create your own point-and-click
adventure games like the old Sierra and Lucasarts classics, but with
modern features such as digital music and alpha blending.

AGS is based around an easy-to-use IDE, where you can set up all the
parts of your game, and then add some script to process game events.
Making a game has never been so productive!

To get started, [read the tutorial](ags9.md#StartingOff).
