## Character Editor

On the Explore Project panel, you can expand the Characters tree to show the
characters in your game. Right clicking on "Characters" entry, you can create a
New character, Import a character previously exported from other project, or
create a folder to help you organize your characters.

By double-clicking on a character from the tree, it will load a panel for the
character, allowing you to view the `NormalView` and `SpechView` for the
selected character, and also to alternatively, mark the character as the player
character if desired. Only one character can be the player.

The properties panel shown will allow you to configure the initial properties of
the character. The lighting bolt icon will switch for the interactions available
for the character, which will allow you to map a function from Global Script to
each interaction from the character.
