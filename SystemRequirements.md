## System Requirements

To work with the Editor, you need following:

- Windows Vista or higher
- .NET Framework 4.5
- Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015

Note that games you create do **NOT** require .NET nor Visual C++
redistributable. If you use the provided installer, the Visual C++ dependency will be installed if it's needed. Recent versions of Windows already provide the necessary .NET Framework pre-installed.

Any games you create have these system requirements:

- Windows Vista or higher
- DirectDraw, Direct3D 9, or OpenGL video support

Game speed is affected by many factors, including how many objects/characters
are on the screen, whether background music is playing, the complexity of your
scripts, and more. The best way to determine the requirements of your game
are to test it on different computer configurations.
