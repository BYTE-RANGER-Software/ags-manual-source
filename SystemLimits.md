## System limits

This section tells you the maximums for various parts of the system. If
you have been wondering "How many rooms can I have?" or something
similar, chances are this section will answer it.

There are maximum...

- 40 objects per room
- 299 state-saving rooms per game
- 300 inventory items
- 30000 imported sprites
- 30 options per dialog topic
- 20 screen overlays at a time
- 5 background frames per room
- 20 mouse cursors
- 8 audio channels
- 100 local messages per room (excluding script)
- 30 fonts

To ensure the pathfinder always works, your walkable areas should always be at least 3 pixels wide.

We are working on removing existing limitations in the AGS, so some of
the remaining restrictions might be loosened or eliminated in the
following updates.
