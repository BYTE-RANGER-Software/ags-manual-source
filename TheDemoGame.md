## The demo game

The first thing you'll probably want to do is to run the demo game. This
game will try to show you some of what AGS can do.

To run the demo, choose the "Open the Demo Game" option from the AGS
folder in your start menu. If you're looking for the files, they're
located in the All Users Application Data folder (this is for
compatibility with the security filters in Windows Vista and later
versions).

**NOTE:** The demo game is currently under development. It has various
unfinished or unimplemented areas.
