Welcome to AGS!

Adventure Game Studio allows you to create your own point-and-click
adventure games like the old Sierra and LucasArts classics.

AGS is based around an easy-to-use IDE, where you can set up all the
parts of your game, and then add some script to process game events.
Making a game has never been so productive!

### Installing AGS

*Note:* AGS Editor is Windows only.

*Download AGS*. The latest stable release is always available from the [AGS Download site](https://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/site/ags/), and beta releases can be found at the top of [Editor Releases Forum](https://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/forums/index.php?board=28.0).

*Install AGS*. Select the Installer and double click on it, or if you downloaded from the forums, there's also an option to get as zip, which can be extracted to a folder you want to.

*Run AGS*. Double-click on `AGSEditor.exe` on the extracted or the installed folder.  If you used the installer, it should have also provided a shortcut on the start menu.

To help you proceed further you should check the manual provided with AGS, which is also [available online here](https://github.com/adventuregamestudio/ags-manual). It's also recommended to participate in [the forums](https://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/forums/)  to get additional help when developing your game.
