The run-time engine
-------------------

The engine (also called the "interpreter") is what runs your game and is
what the end player will use.

If you are using the default interface, then you use the right mouse
button to cycle between the available 'modes', and the left button to
use the current mode on the mouse position. You can also move the mouse
to the top of the screen to bring up the icon bar where you can directly
select a mode. To exit the engine, press Ctrl-Q. You can save your game
position using F5 and restore with F7.

The controls described above work with the default setup; however, you
can customize your game to use a different interface and shortcut keys.
