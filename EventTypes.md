## Event Types

In AGS certain types of game objects may have individual events, that is - events that are run for a *particular object* when something happens to it.
These events do not have predefined functions, unlike [Global event handlers](Globalfunctions_Event). Instead each object has an event table, where you may connect a script function to some event.

In the Editor the event tables may be found in the "Events" section of the Properties Window (when clicking the lightning bolt icon).

It's important to note that each event type corresponds to its own function type, which defines function arguments. To give an example, Button's OnClick event demands a function that looks like:

    function ButtonName_Click(GUIControl *control, MouseButton button)

If two or more events have same function type, then it is also possible to connect one function to all of them. Similarily, it is possible to connect one function to events from multiple objects. This may be useful in case you prefer to have a generic behavior for them. In such case the function arguments may usually be used to tell which object and which event called the function.

For example, if multiple Buttons are connected to the same Click function, mentioned above, then you may use `control` argument to refer to the button that was clicked, and `button` argument to know which mouse button performed the click.

Following is a list of events per game object type.

### Room events

**Enters room before fade-in**

    function room_Load()

Occurs just after the room is loaded into memory. This event occurs
every time the player enters the screen, and it happens BEFORE the
screen has faded in, which allows you to change object graphics and do
other things to the screen which the player won't notice.

**NOTE:** This event is ONLY meant for adjusting things such as object and
character placement. Do NOT use this event for any sort of automated
intro to the room - use the "Enters Room After Fade In" event for that
instead.

**Enters room after fade-in**

    function room_AfterFadeIn()

Occurs every time the player enters the room, AFTER the screen has
faded-in. Suitable for playing cutscenes.

**First time enters room**

    function room_FirstLoad()

Occurs the first time the player enters the room. This event occurs
AFTER the screen has faded in, and right before the "Player enters room (after fade-in)" event.

**Leaves room before fade out**

    function room_Leave()

Occurs when the player leaves the screen, just BEFORE the screen fades
out.

**Leaves room after fade out**

    function room_Unload()

Occurs when the player leaves the screen, AFTER the screen has faded-out.
This event is suitable for stopping room music and deleting temporary resources, such as Dynamic Sprites.

**Repeatedly execute**

    function room_RepExec()

Occurs repeatedly on every game cycle, at a frequency defined by the game speed (for example if game speed is 40, then this event will occur 40 times per second, about every 25 milliseconds). This event is a equivalent of a global `repeatedly_execute` callback, as `repeatedly_execute` is not run in room scripts.

**Walk off left edge**

    function room_LeaveLeft()

occurs when the player character walks off the left Room Edge.

**Walk off right edge**

    function room_LeaveRight()

occurs when the player walks off the right Room Edge.

**Walk off bottom edge**

    function room_LeaveBottom()

occurs when the player character walks off the bottom Room Edge.

**Walk off top edge**

    function room_LeaveTop()

occurs when the player character walks off the top Room Edge.
